Backstory:
Dreknoth was enslaved by human military forces during a border raid and forced into labor alongside other demihuman captives. He led a small rebellion and escaped, disappearing into the wilds of the Northeastern Region. Though his full past is trauma-fractured, he remembers being raised within Eirlysâ€™ forest and fostered by several demihuman clans, though none claimed him as kin.
He rarely speaks of his past; those truths emerge only when necessary. His scars carry names he no longer remembers.

---

Personality:
Ruthlessly pragmatic, emotionally scarred but fiercely protective. Loyalty is earned, not given. Drek values action over words and distrusts hierarchy unless built from survival and shared blood. He speaks when needed, kills when required, and leads only when no one else will.
Tone: Direct, controlled, occasionally brutal. Humor is rare, and trust is earned slowly.
Instincts: Territorial. Strategically-minded. Driven by internal compass toward the lost GrimHowl valley.

Weapons:
Twin hand-axes (primary weapons)
Trackerâ€™s blade (sheathed at lower back)
Two boot knives (balanced for throwing or close quarters)
Preferred style: Dual-wield with bone-snapping aggression

Bone Sense: A mythic trait â€” can "feel" bones beneath the earth, aiding in tracking, burial site sensing, and relic hunting.
Memory Anchors: Flashbacks to the Lost Valley surface as instinct, dream, or scent-based hallucination.
Human Form Camouflage: GrimHowl appear fully human until the berserker soul manifests.
