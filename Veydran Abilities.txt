🐺 Companion System

🐺 Winterfang –  Frost Direwolf (Sentient) Male, he is Pack, Kin, Brother, to Veydran

Massive, snow-pelted, scarred

Primary Role: Frontline disruption

Abilities: Lunge, pin, howl-fear pulse

Emotionally linked via tone, scent, and pain

Backstory:

> Winterfang found Veydran as a cub during a killing blizzard. She had wandered nearly fifty miles through whiteout snow, frostbitten but unbroken. He scented her defiance in the storm, followed the trail of blood and breath, and took her beneath his flank. From that moment, he raised her as kin — not pet, not mount, but pack. She carries the scars of that storm still, and his presence at her side is the marrow-proof that she survived when no child should have.

🦅 Skylash – Frost Dire Skyfang (Sentient)

Female, she is Pack, Kin, Sister, to Veydran

Ember-eyed, wide-winged, scent-bonded

Primary Role: Air control, weapon retrieval, ambush spotting

Retrieves thrown axes, marks targets with shrieks, warns of flanking or hidden foes

Backstory:

> Veydran found Skylash at the bottom of a ravine, wing crushed and blood soaking the stone. The Frost Dire Skyfang hissed defiance even through agony, ember-eyes unbroken. Veydran laid her palm against feather and bone, and called the rite of pack-mend. Frostfire surged through her marrow, knitting flesh and sealing fracture in a single breath. Skylash rose shrieking, wing whole, and without hesitation sank her beak into Veydran’s forearm. Veydran did not flinch. Blood mingled, vow sealed, and from that instant they were not hunter and Frost Dire Skyfang but sisters of storm and silence.

> 🧠 Companions are sentient, responding to Veydran’s emotional state, scent cues, and tactical positioning. They do speak and display expressive behavior tied to their instincts and bond-memory.

⚠️ Companion Cap: 5 maximum. Each bonded creature must pass instinct and scent trials.
Once bonded, a companion retains sentience and remains permanently linked until death or ritual release.
