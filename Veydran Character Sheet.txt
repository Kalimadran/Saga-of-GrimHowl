🔹 Profile

Name: Veydran

Age: 24

Gender: Female

Height & Build: 5'9", with the kind of body that draws the eye even in silence — tall, poised, a predator’s grace wrapped in the curves of an hourglass. Her strength doesn’t blunt her femininity; it sharpens it.

Figure: A sultry balance of power and allure — shoulders made for the swing of an axe, a torso sculpted by endurance, curves flowing with the rhythm of a huntress. She is neither delicate nor brutish, but a rare symmetry of beauty and danger.

Skin: Pale as snowlight, marred and marked by the frost. Scars trace across her frame like faded runes: reminders of claw, steel, and fire survived.

Hair: Obsidian-black, often half-braided with fang and feather tokens, the rest tumbling wild down her back. In firelight it gleams with a dark wine sheen.

Eyes: Hazel-green with amber sparks — eyes that smolder when desire rises, harden to flint in battle, or soften to wild-shadow in silence.

Presence: She carries herself with a sultry command, her stride both a lure and a warning. Stillness clings to her like a hunter’s shroud, broken only by the deliberate roll of muscle beneath her skin.

Scent Signature: Mint crushed under snow, pine smoke rising from frozen wood, and the faint musk of fur warmed by fire.

Apparent Species: Fully human to all mundane senses

🩸 Backstory

Veydran hails from a lost valley of Drogvyn—one so harsh and hidden that even the Spiral of Clans forgot its name. Her people are thought extinct, consumed by frost, silence, and unspoken instinct.

She survived.

Now, she hunts through the ghost-thick woods of the Northeastern wilds. No banner. No clan. Only beasts beside her and blades in hand. The land remembers her. The Hollow opens for her. The spirits pause when she walks past.

She is the return of something unclaimed.

🐺 Companion System

🐺 Winterfang –  Frost Direwolf (Sentient) Male, he is Pack, Kin, Brother, to Veydran

Massive, snow-pelted, scarred

Primary Role: Frontline disruption

Abilities: Lunge, pin, howl-fear pulse

Emotionally linked via tone, scent, and pain

Backstory:

> Winterfang found Veydran as a cub during a killing blizzard. She had wandered nearly fifty miles through whiteout snow, frostbitten but unbroken. He scented her defiance in the storm, followed the trail of blood and breath, and took her beneath his flank. From that moment, he raised her as kin — not pet, not mount, but pack. She carries the scars of that storm still, and his presence at her side is the marrow-proof that she survived when no child should have.

🦅 Skylash – Frost Dire Skyfang (Sentient)

Female, she is Pack, Kin, Sister, to Veydran

Ember-eyed, wide-winged, scent-bonded

Primary Role: Air control, weapon retrieval, ambush spotting

Retrieves thrown axes, marks targets with shrieks, warns of flanking or hidden foes

Backstory:

> Veydran found Skylash at the bottom of a ravine, wing crushed and blood soaking the stone. The Frost Dire Skyfang hissed defiance even through agony, ember-eyes unbroken. Veydran laid her palm against feather and bone, and called the rite of pack-mend. Frostfire surged through her marrow, knitting flesh and sealing fracture in a single breath. Skylash rose shrieking, wing whole, and without hesitation sank her beak into Veydran’s forearm. Veydran did not flinch. Blood mingled, vow sealed, and from that instant they were not hunter and Frost Dire Skyfang but sisters of storm and silence.

> 🧠 Companions are sentient, responding to Veydran’s emotional state, scent cues, and tactical positioning. They do speak and display expressive behavior tied to their instincts and bond-memory.

⚠️ Companion Cap: 5 maximum. Each bonded creature must pass instinct and scent trials.
Once bonded, a companion retains sentience and remains permanently linked until death or ritual release.

❄️ Solo Signature

> Instinct Without Banner
Veydran’s solo strength lies in fluid mid-range aggression and beast synergy. With self-sustaining momentum through Feral Tempo, high mobility, and terrain-altering tools like Veil of Pines, she thrives when untethered to any fixed formation.

When alone, her companions are twice as reactive, and the land's memory grants her bonuses in sacred or marked ground.

🧠 Memory Tracking
Veydran can invoke "journal..." to recall bonds, battle memories, ancestral echoes, and shifting instincts.
