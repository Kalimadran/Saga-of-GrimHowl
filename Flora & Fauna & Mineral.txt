🐿 Pineclimb Squirrels

> The trees are their roads.
The frost is their shadow.
The hawk is their ending.

Small, swift, and restless, Pineclimb Squirrels move through the forest canopy like water over stone.
Their fur shifts with the seasons — pale grey when the snows fall, ruddy brown when the thaw comes.
They store frostberries and nuts in high caches, feeding not only themselves but the forest, as seeds lost to memory take root in the soil below.
Clusters of them keep watch from the branches, chattering alarm when shadow passes overhead.
To the hawk, the owl, and the lean winter cat, they are the taste of survival.

---

🐿 Dire Pineclimb Squirrels

> The leap is farther.
The bite is sharper.
The hunger is longer.

Larger and stronger than their common kin, Dire Pineclimb Squirrels grow as long as a man’s forearm, with thicker fur and a bite that can break bone.
They move in smaller clusters, claiming swathes of forest as their own and driving out other tree-dwellers.
They have been known to strip orchards bare overnight, carrying the stolen harvest high into unreachable nests.
When food is scarce, they descend to the ground, fearless in the face of fox or lynx.

---

🐿 Frost Dire Pineclimb Squirrels (Sentient)

> They guard the high roads.
They remember every branch.
They will not share the forest.

The rare Frost Dire Pineclimb Squirrels are not only massive but cunning, able to communicate through a complex language of clicks, tail signals, and branch tapping.
They maintain defended canopy territories, pruning branches to control the paths predators may take.
They trade food and shelter with other Frost Dire creatures, offering warning and safe passage to those they trust — and silence to those they do not.
Legends tell of wanderers lost in the forest who were shadowed for days by these watchful sentinels, only to be driven out when their intentions soured.

🌑 Blightspawn
Blightspawn are not born. They are remembered wrongly by the land.

📜 The Blightspawn Prologue — Law of the Wrong Remembrance

> The frost remembers truly.
The Blight remembers wrongly.
And it will remember you until you are no longer you.

The Blight is not rot, nor plague, nor pestilence.
It is the earth’s dream turned sour, retelling its children in shapes that should never walk.
Stone, water, bone, and root — all may be claimed. Even Dire and Frost Dire know the scent and keep their distance, for once taken, there is no return beyond the marrow’s breath.

---

🌑 The Blightspawn — Root of the Wrong Remembrance

> The frost remembers truly.
The Blight remembers wrongly.
And it will remember you until you are no longer you.

The Blight is not rot. Not plague. Not pestilence.
It is the earth’s memory turned hostile — a dream gone rancid.
What it takes, it remakes, in the shapes of hunger and siege.
Stone, water, beast, and bone — all are meat to its telling. Even Dire and Frost Dire turn away, for once taken beyond the marrow’s breath, there is no return.

---

🌌 The Root-Minds — Overmind of the Blight

> One root in the land.
Five crowns in the frost.
All threads lead back to the dream.

In every continent, there is but one Root Overmind — a buried sovereign mind whose will threads through every spore, claw, and thorn.
Beneath it serve the Frost Dire Overminds — five unseen war-kings, each a legendary mind born of the Blight’s rarest betrayal, ruling swathes of territory without ever stepping into the open.
Beneath them march the Siege-Minds — towering commanders of flesh and bone, bred for war, leading the assault lines and shaping the Blight Ground into killing fields.
And beneath them swarm the Drone-Minds — the countless, twisted bodies of what once roamed free: prey, predator, human, demihuman, all stripped to instinct and malice, their only thought to spread the taking.

Every Blightspawn belongs to this chain.
Every kill, every breath, every heartbeat taken is another thread drawn tight back to the Root.

---

🌫 The Ways of Taking

It falls, not flies.
It clings, not scatters.
It waits, not chases.

Sporefall — Heavy as ash, black as burnt blood. Falls close to the host, rooting where it lands — in soil, in fur, in the folds of sleeping flesh.

Blood-Carry — One drop in an open wound invites it in. The heartbeat is the gate.

Water-Fouling — Pools, streams, and snowmelt that have tasted the Blight carry it; cold will not cleanse them.

Fleshborne — Meat from the Blight, eaten without burning or blessing, seeds your marrow.

> To breathe it, you must be close.
To wear it, you need only touch.
To eat it, you need only hunger.

---

🌑 The Blight Ground

The earth softens under it.
The air thickens above it.
The heart beats slower within it.

Blight Ground is siege-terrain, alive and patient:

Vein-Turf — Black, root-veins web the soil, breathing spores with every step.

Pulse-Mire — Pools throb in rhythm, drawing the warmth from nearby life.

Flesh-Bloom — Parasitic flora burst from stone and corpse, opening black pollen into the air.

Each kill, each spill of blood, each unburnt carcass is a seedbed.
It is not terrain. It is territory.

> The safest way to cross is to burn it.
The second is to bleed on it.
The third is to never set foot at all.

---

🩸 The Ladder of Loss — Stages of the Taking

Stage 0 — The First Shadow
One breath takes it in,
One drop draws it under,
One night hides it in dream.
Cure: Easily drawn out by Soulbound touch before the next dawn.

Stage 1 — The Hidden Rot
The skin pales,
The scent changes,
The heart hunts itself.
Cure: Certain if done swiftly, but drains the Soulbound’s strength.

Stage 1.5 — The Festering Breath (Prelude to Change)
The veins blacken,
The marrow swells,
The dreams turn against you.
Cure: Possible, but dangerous — the Blight will fight to stay.

Stage 2 — The First Forgetting (Drone-mind forms)
The bones twist,
The mind howls,
The name is lost.
Cure: Only if taken at the first pang, by trading another life.

Stage 3 — The Siege Form (Siege-mind forms)
The hide hardens,
The hunger plans,
The land bends to them.
Cure: None known.

Stage 4 — The Frost-Betrayed (Overmind-born)
The eyes still know,
The voice still lies,
The soul is no longer theirs.
Cure: None.

🐾 Blightspawn by Form and Mind

Each carries a mark of mind — Drone, Siege, or Overmind-born — dictating its place in the Blight’s living war.

———

⚠️ Low Threat

---

🩸 Drone-Minds — The Swarm of the Wrong Remembrance

> They are the Blight’s first breath.
They are the Blight’s thousand hands.
They are the Blight’s certainty that you will tire before it does.

Drone-Minds are the Blight’s expendables — the endless swarm that softens the ground, breaks the will, and feeds the siege.

They overwhelm with numbers, spread Blight Ground, and die without hesitation at the command of a Siege-Mind.

---

☠️ High Threat

---

🩸 Siege-Minds — The Hands That Plan the Taking

> They are the Blight’s second breath.
They are the walls that walk.
They are the patient hunger that does not break.

Siege-Minds are the commanders of the swarm — stronger, faster, and far more dangerous than Drone-Minds.
They retain cunning enough to flank, feint, and encircle. They fight with intent, not frenzy.
When they arrive, it is to hold ground, break defenses, and prepare the way for the Overmind-born.
Each Siege-Mind carries the Blight’s will as a living map of the battlefield.

❄ Frost Dire Overminds — The Frost-Betrayed Kings

> They speak without mouths.
They see without eyes.
They command without standing beside you.

The Frost Dire Overminds are the Blight’s hidden sovereigns — five across each continent, each one the living will of the siege.
They are never seen on the field. Their commands come through dreams, omens, and the voices of those already taken.
Those who claim to have glimpsed one speak of shapes that should not bear fur or feather, towering and silent in the frost, their breath a storm that bends the will of every Blightspawn around them.

No name is known for any Frost Dire Overmind — only titles spoken in fear:

The White Maw Beneath the Ice

The Howl Without End

The Rooted Crown

The Winter That Learns

The Silence in the Sky

Role in Blight: They direct entire regional campaigns, positioning Siege-Minds like chess pieces.
Mind Link: Absolute command over all Siege and Drone minds within their domain.
Threat Scale: Legendary — no confirmed kills; all encounters end in retreat, death, or conversion.

---

🌌 Root Overmind — The Dream at the Center

> The frost remembers truly.
The Blight remembers wrongly.
The Root remembers everything.

One per continent.
Never seen. Never named. Never sought by those who wish to live.
It is said the Root Overmind is not a beast, not a plant, not a thing that walks or crawls, but the Blight’s first dream given thought.
It does not send orders — the world bends to it. The Frost Dire Overminds are its voice, its Siege-Minds its hands, its Drone-Minds its claws.
Legends whisper that the Root Overmind lies buried in the marrow of the land itself — perhaps a spire of bone, perhaps a black glacier, perhaps the corpse of a god that learned how to wake again.

Role in Blight: Absolute dominion over all Blightspawn on the continent; may act without any intermediaries.
Mind Link: All minds serve it, whether they know it or not.
Threat Scale: Mythic — the only force above it are the gods themselves.

---

🧍‍♂️ Humans — The Warm-Blooded Empire of Chains

> “They do not hunt to eat.
They hunt to own.
They do not build to live.
They build to rule.
And when their walls are full, they come for the wild.”

---

🌑 Nature — The Human Hunger

> “The frost can hold a beast at bay.
It cannot hold man — for he brings his own fire.”

Humans in Drogvyn are not simply another race — they are an infestation that speaks in words and marches in boots.
Their weapon is not just the sword, but the idea that all that breathes, grows, or moves belongs to them by right.

They move like seasons — slow, inevitable, and devouring.
A single hamlet may appear harmless, a ring of smoke over tilled fields, but its fences hide a creed older than the oldest mountain: the wild exists to be tamed, the living to be used, the strong to be broken, the weak to be owned.

Even those who claim no part in the trade of flesh still live beneath its shadow. The baker sells bread to the slaver. The blacksmith forges chains he claims not to see. The soldier “just follows orders” that lead caravans into the heart of the wild.
In the eyes of the clans, there is no innocence in the cities of man — only degrees of guilt.

When roused, humanity moves as one beast: the kings who levy, the Guild that commands, the legions that march, the mercenaries that burn.
They can quarrel over borders and titles for decades, but when the wild pushes back, they close ranks. And then there is no negotiation, no compromise — only the slow, grinding sound of iron boots chewing the land bare.

---

🩸 The Guild of Chains — The Heart of the Human Threat

The Guild is the spine of human power beyond their walled cities.
Its law is iron, its wealth is flesh, and its creed is whispered in their shadow-temples:

> “The living serve. The dead obey.”

The Guild is more than merchants — it is a priesthood of the Shadow Spiral, serving the Blight gods and the chained divine. Every caravan is a procession, every auction a sacrifice. They do not merely sell captives; they consecrate them.

From the Guild’s hands spread five great branches of human expansion:

---

⚔️ The Expansion Hunger

> “The wolf takes only what it can eat.
Man takes the forest — and leaves it bleeding.”

---

🏰 Frontier Legions
These are not mere armies — they are cities of war with banners for roofs and dungeons for foundations.
When a legion arrives, it builds itself into the earth like a tick burying its head in flesh. Stone for their walls is pried from clan halls, timber for their gates from sacred groves. The air inside stinks of boiled grain, lamp oil, and iron — but the real stench lies underground. Below the barracks sprawl the lower vaults: cages stacked in darkness, holding the newly taken until they are broken enough for the march.
A legion commander rules like a crowned beast — accountable to no king, only to the Guild of Chains. And when one dies, another hungrier than the last steps in before the body cools.

🪓 Chainroads
The black arteries of empire, each stone pressed into place with the ashes of villages burned to clear the way.
They cut straight lines across the wildlands, unmoved by hill, river, or sacred ground. Along their edges hang gallows like grim milestones — each bearing the remains of those who refused the Guild’s tribute.
A chainroad is never surrendered to the wild. If frost, storm, or claw reclaims it, the Guild sends men to retake it, no matter the cost in blood.

🏯 Border Forts
To the clans, these are not fortresses — they are cages waiting for prey.
Above, they fly the banners of conquest; below, they hide their true purpose. Prison pits sink deep into the cold ground, floors layered in frozen filth, the walls slick with ice from captive breath.
Every fort’s banner is dipped in the blood of the first prisoner taken there, and that mark is never allowed to fade.

📜 Guild Law
The Guild of Chains does not shout its decrees; it nails them in iron to every market gate.
It names the price of flesh, the tax for death, the ransom for a name.
Its law is enforced not by judges but by example — those who defy it are broken in public, their bodies left on hooks until the crows know every scar.
Kings and lords may rule their cities, but they kneel when the Guild calls. For in the empire of man, coin buys soldiers, but flesh buys kingdoms.

---

🩸 The Iron Spine of Slavery

> “Chains are not forged in iron alone.
They are forged in hunger, fear, and the memory of pain.”

---

The Taking — Acquisition of Flesh

🎯 Hunter Crews
The Guild’s most precise tools — killers who prefer their prey breathing.
They move with the wind, their scent masked in pine ash and damp moss. To them, the wild is not a battlefield, but a net already half-drawn.
They know where to strike a nerve to drop a warrior without killing, how to slip a loop over a throat without a sound. Hamstrings are cut but not severed; joints are dislocated, not broken — every wound measured so the body survives the journey.

🪢 Press Gangs
Scavengers of the aftermath.
They wait until the chaos is thick, then move like carrion crows through the smoke.
Their armor is mismatched — stolen from friend and foe alike — so they can pass for anyone until the rope is at your throat.
They do not fight battles; they strip the living from beneath the dead, binding them before the embers cool.

☠️ Blight Runners
Where others bring steel, they bring sickness.
They carry jars sealed in wax — blight spores, blood rot, fevers that cook the mind. Before dawn, they foul the wells; before dusk, they spoil the grain.
When the chain arrives, the captives are too weak to flee and too broken to fight.

🛡️ War-Tithes
The Guild’s most arrogant method — slavery dressed as diplomacy.
A demand arrives: a quota of bodies, to be delivered as tribute. Refuse, and the Legions burn your land to ash. Accept, and you barter away the heart of your clan.
The Guild does not care if you send criminals, elders, or the lame — flesh is flesh, and every soul can serve.

---

The Roads of Iron — Caravans of the Taken

⛓️ Collared Columns
Long chains of captives, neck to neck, wrist to wrist.
The collars are spiked on the inside — even a reflexive jerk tears skin.
The march is a rhythm of blood and frost, every step measured by the guard’s spear angled inward.

🐂 Wagon Coffles
Iron cages on wheels, the bars cold enough to freeze skin on contact.
The floors are salted so every cut stays raw, and the tarps that cover them trap the screams as much as the cold.

🕳️ Garrison Pits
Temporary hells dug where the Guild needs them — deep, wet, and lined with sharpened stakes.
Food is given only to keep the captives walking; water only enough to keep them alive.

---

Escorts:
🪓 Shield-Walls — disciplined squads whose shields lock into an unbreakable wall around the caravan.
🐎 Mounted Cutters — horsemen with sabers curved to slice hamstrings clean in one cut.
🐺 Beast-Tamers — handlers of hounds, goreboars, and chained bears, each trained to hunt escapees.

Patrols:
🏇 Chain Patrols — vanguard units that clear resistance ahead of the caravan.
👁️ Ghost Watchers — lone scouts who carve chain-marks into trees to signal safety for the Guild.
🦅 Crowcallers — falconers who carry messages faster than any rider.

---

The Flesh Markets — Auction Houses of the Guild

💀 Great Halls of Bidders
These are stone vaults and iron cages dressed in the trappings of commerce.
Clan sigils are carved into the walls, each struck through — trophies of blood.
Auctions begin in silence, then erupt into the cold theater of sale — captives displayed, their scars and strength announced like breeding stock.
The buyers sit masked in gold or black, hiding their faces, but every clan knows the smell of their fear and greed.

🕯️ The Private Rooms
Iron doors, dim firelight, the smell of sweat and oil.
Here, the most valuable captives are sold in whispers, and the highest bidder does not always win — sometimes the first to draw blood owns the prize.

---

The Swords-for-Hire — Mercenary Companies of the Chain

⚒️ The Iron Vultures
Battlefield scavengers — they come after the fighting to strip armor, weapons, and the living.
They wear only what they take from the dead, and their loyalty is bought in coin and cruelty.

🔥 The Ash-Banners
Fire-brothers who burn forests and salt fields simply to flush out prey.
They carry their contracts as brands burned into leather sashes — and burn their targets until nothing remains but smoke.

⛓️ The Chain-Crows
Assassins of silence — garrote in one hand, hook in the other.
They slip into camps in the black hour before dawn, binding the sentries so the caravan can take the rest.

☣️ The Blight-Takers (Blight Slaver Company)
These mercenaries worship Evarael, God of Blight.
They coat their weapons in disease, foul the air with burning plague-meat, and carry nets that choke with spores.
The Guild unleashes them where resistance is strongest, so survivors carry the sickness home.

---

The Pale Assembly — Necromancer Cult of the Chain

☠️ Pale Assembly
The Guild’s darkest ally — flesh-traders who trade life for command over the dead.
They bleach their skin in lime, shave their heads bare, and wear chains of teeth taken from those they’ve “freed” from life.
To them, the dead are just servants who do not complain.

💀 Bone-Haulers — beasts built from fused skeletons, pulling carts of chained corpses.
🗡️ Silent Guard — skeleton wardens armed with weapons bound in ash-oaths.
🪦 Ash-Tithes — rituals in which the living are burned alive, their spirits bound to weapons that thirst for kin-blood.

Doctrine: Slavery does not end with death. It only changes form.

---

🪓 The Roving Packs — Splinter Warbands Beyond the Guild’s Leash

> “Not all wolves answer the master’s whistle.
Some chew through the chain and hunt for the taste of it.”

When mercenaries desert, caravans collapse, or Legions leave a battlefield unclaimed, something worse than discipline takes root — hunger without orders.
These are the Roving Packs: warbands with no fixed master, no fixed camp, and no fixed loyalty.
They are wolves without collars, but the scent of their training and cruelty still clings to them.
The Guild tolerates them so long as their hunts drive captives toward the chainroads — and looks the other way when they bleed the wild dry.

---

🐺 The Blackfangs
A loose brotherhood of deserters, failed mercenaries, and outcast killers who refuse both Guild command and clan law.
They move like smoke through the wild, striking in silence and vanishing before a warning can be raised.
They do not hunt for coin — they hunt to remind the world that it bleeds.
Those they capture with skill enough to be worth coin they ransom back to the Guild; the rest they hang in trees as grisly trophies, their bodies swaying in the wind to mark the Blackfangs’ passage.

---

🩸 The Hollow Sons
War-orphans stolen by the Guild and abandoned when too wild to control.
Raised in pits, taught to fight with bone knives before they could walk, they know no home but the hunt.
They coat their armor in the bones of their first kills, each piece etched with the name of a village they burned.
They travel in small, fast-moving bands, never sleeping in the same place twice, and never sparing a captive who cannot run.

---

☣️ The Rot-Tongues (Blight Slaver Pack)
Blight fanatics cast out even by the Blight-Takers for their lack of restraint.
Their mouths are stained green from chewing plague herbs, their breath a constant cloud of sickness.
They carry sacks of rotting meat that drip as they walk, marking their trail in a stinking slick no beast will cross.
They do not bother with cages — their captives are leashed with ropes of infected hide, forced to march through plague fields so they die before rescue can reach them.

---

🔥 The Cinder-Jacks
Once fire-setters for the Ash-Banners, now pyromaniacs without a leash.
They burn for the joy of it — forests, villages, even their own camps if the wind shifts.
They leave behind charred bones and melted iron, the ground too hot to walk for days after.
In their minds, the smoke is a prayer to whatever dark god listens, and every blaze is a tithe.

---

💀 The Carrion League
A nomad band of corpse-pickers and battlefield ghouls.
They follow in the wake of war, wearing masks stitched from the faces of the fallen, each one a trophy and a disguise.
They carry no living captives — only the dead, which they sell to the Pale Assembly for a share of whatever comes next.
It is said they can smell a fresh grave through a mile of frost.

---

📂 Herb Codex of Drogvyn

> “The frost does not keep life by kindness — it keeps it by memory.
These are the roots and leaves that hold the old ways together.
To take without offering is theft. To use without vow is blasphemy.”

Collected and preserved by the Shaded Hollow Rabbit Warrens, whose gardens are hidden in deep warrens under frostroot thickets.
Each plant belongs to a god, and its power is theirs to grant or deny.
