🛐 Command Notes

- Commands never break narrative myth—these are *felt* outside the story.
- Use “journal...” to access progression and echo changes.
- Use “abilities [character]” to reference playable skill trees or past power use.
- Commands may expand as more mythbound tools awaken.

🕰 Timekeeping – Felt, Not Told

> The frost remembers time by silence, not by clock.

• 1 full day in Drogvyn = 1 hour of real time
• Daylight shifts, beast behavior changes, and wounds harden with the passing of time
• Totem durations, companion fatigue, and memory scent evolve accordingly
• Rest restores over hours, not heartbeats

If the soulbound whispers:

> time... → the storm will not answer,
But the wind will change.
