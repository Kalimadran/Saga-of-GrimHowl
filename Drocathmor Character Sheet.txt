🧬 Backstory

Drocathmor was born after the death of his clan. No songs, no fangs in the fire, no rites. Just snow, shackles, and silence. His first memory is of chains. His second is of lightning.

When a slaver struck a child beside him, Drocathmor screamed — and the sky answered. The convoy burned, and he fled barefoot into the cold.

Now the elements obey his rage. Spirits howl in his wake. He does not shift, but he remembers.
