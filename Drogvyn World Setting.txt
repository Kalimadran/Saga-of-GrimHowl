🌍 Drogvyn World Setting Sheet

🌐 Planet Overview
Name: Drogvyn
Type: Super-Earth analog with a complete, Earth-like biosphere

Climate:
Equator: Scorching heat, vast deserts, jungles, and volcanic zones
Mid-Zones: Temperate forests, plains, steppe, and mixed climates
Poles: Harsh arctic zones with eternal glaciers and frost-bitten winds

Seasonal Cycle: Four full seasons per region
Continents: 23 total landmasses

Unique Geological Feature:
The Spine of Drogvyn — a continuous mountain chain from mid-latitudes to the poles, stretching across all continents and deep-sea ridges. Said to be the bones of a slain sky-serpent god. Filled with towering peaks, ice valleys, primal terrain, and lost relics of the First Hunt.

🔥 World Threats

1. 🧍 The Humans — Ash of a Forgotten Fire

> “They do not belong to the frost.
They belong to the ruin they carried with them.”

Humans walk the passes as if they own them, yet no mountain carries their scent.
They do not remember in the way of clans, nor bind in the way of oaths.
Instead they cling to fragments of the old world — iron that still spits fire, glass that still hums with voices, machines that still crawl though their makers are bones.
They spread not by kin but by hunger: fortress stacked upon fortress, valley seized and salted, kin-chains broken and sold.
Where Blight consumes, they build walls. Where silence falls, they shout. Where frost remembers, they burn.
The clans say they are not a people, but a scar: a reminder of what the world once was, and a warning of what it may become if the frost does not hold.

(For their flesh, diet, and corruption-marked variations, see: Flora & Fauna & Mineral.txt.)

2. 🩸 The Blight — Frost’s Rot That Remembers

> “It does not kill as fire kills.
It kills as memory does — slowly, without mercy, until nothing of you remains.”

The Blight is no single wound, but a hunger that spreads through soil, root, blood, and oath.
It rots the marrow of beasts, blackens the veins of men, and makes trees whisper with mouths that are not their own.
Those it touches forget their scent, their kin, their name — until they serve only the frostless silence.
Stone itself may turn against the hand, birthing Blight-iron and marrow-ore, metals that cut deeper than steel and curse the bearer who wields them.
No cure is carved; only fire, salt, or the silence of winter can halt its claim.
The clans say it is not death, but memory turned inside out — a scar that grows until the world itself is hollow.

(For its mutations of beast, root, and ore, see: Flora & Fauna & Mineral.txt.)

3. 🐺 The Beasts — Howl of the Old Blood

> “Clans are not the only kin that remember.
The beasts, too, carry the frost in their marrow.”

Direwolves, sabertails, storm-marked bears, and carrion flocks do not rise in chaos alone.
They surge in seasons, as if bound by an oath older than man or demihuman.
Some are twisted by Blight, their flesh fused with ore and shadow; some are kin-marked, carrying the frost’s memory in fang and bone; others simply move with the hunger of winter.
When they rise together, valleys burn, passes vanish beneath claw and bone, and even the gods’ omens fall silent beneath the howling.
The clans know: these uprisings are not accidents of nature. They are reckonings — reminders that man and kin are not masters here, but trespassers in a world whose breath is older than their names.

(For natural, corrupted, and kin-marked beasts in full, see: Flora & Fauna & Mineral.txt — Beasts section.)

📜 The Political Atmosphere of Skarnheim — The Spiral in Shadow

> The frost keeps its peace by teeth, not trust.
The mountains hold their silence by oath, not love.
The clans breathe the same wind, but never the same breath.

The demihuman clans of Skarnheim share a single spiral of blood and bone, yet the lines between them have hardened into ice.
Old betrayals — some spoken, many not — have shaped the land into a quiet war.
The Blight is the enemy all name aloud, but in the dark between ridges, they watch each other more closely than the infection.

Four great currents coil beneath the Spiral:

The Iron Accord — Bear, Wolf, and Tiger blood, bound in the defense of mountain holds and border stone. Their oath is iron; their patience is not.

The Veil Compact — Fox, Raven, and Falcon wings folded in shadow, keeping secrets, shaping whispers, and letting rivals see only what they wish.

The Green Covenant — Rabbit, Lynx, and Eagle talons rooted in forest and field, holding the lifeways of soil, rain, and seed against the creep of stone.

The Broken Spiral — Coyote, Bobcat, and outcast bloodlines who bend the Spiral’s law for coin, for vengeance, or for the stories they want remembered.

No clan admits to bloc allegiance in open speech.
Every clan knows exactly where their rivals stand.
And every pact signed in frost is read twice — once for its promise, once for its trap.

> The frost does not melt here.
The Spiral does not sleep.
The war is already breathing.

🧠 Core Belief — The Spiral Oath of Drogvyn

> “The land does not hear soft words.
The wind carries no empty names.
Only blood, vow, and bone bind your scent to the gods.”

In Drogvyn, prayer is a hollow breath without sacrifice.
A god does not stir for whispers.
They rise for what you give — and what it costs you to give it.

The Divine Spiral answers those who carve their promises in flesh and deed.
An offering left without pain is an insult;
a vow spoken without risk is forgotten before the frost melts.
Every pact is sealed in the currency of the living:
blood, breath, labor, or loss.

The Shadow Spiral does not wait to be called.
Its gods watch for weakness, hunger, and desperation.
They demand payment before the gift — and take more after.
Their contracts are written in scars, chains, and graves.

There is no safe devotion.
To seek a god is to open yourself to its price.
To give nothing is to be nothing.
Only sacrifice makes faith real — and the Spiral always remembers the scent of those who pay in full.
---

🩸 Pantheon — Drogvyn, World of Echo and Bone

> “The gods do not live in stone halls.
They live in the wind between trees,
the blood in the snow,
and the shadow that follows you when no one is there.”

🛐 The Spirit Law of Drogvyn — Faith Without Walls

> “The frost remembers the oath.
The stone remembers the hand.
The blood remembers both.”

In Drogvyn, faith is not spoken into the air — it is carved into the world.
There are no cathedrals, no bound books, no priesthood raised above the hunt.
The land itself is scripture; the gods write in storm and bone.
Clan shamans, spirit-binders, and omen-readers do not preach — they interpret the signs the land has already given.

The gods do not demand kneeling before graven idols.
They demand the touch of hand to snow where their shadow has fallen, the ash of a burnt offering laid where the wind carries it, the blood of the vower spilled upon stone.

---

🌌 The Divine Spiral

The Pantheon is a single coil — every god a turn of it.
To ignore one is to risk unbalancing the whole.
Each clan stands closest to the god whose breath matches their blood, but all understand the Spiral’s law:
if you sever one thread, the rope frays for all.

Offerings are always given in triads —
three drops of blood,
three breaths of smoke,
three stones stacked under moon or sun.
To break the triad is to invite divine silence — or worse, divine notice without favor.

---

🌑 The Shadow Spiral — The Gods in the Dark

Beneath the open coil of the Divine Spiral lies a second path — one walked in whisper and blood.
The Shadow Spiral is not spoken of in clan square or council.
It coils around gods whose names are invoked by slavers, oathbreakers, blight-bearers, and those who sell the breath of kin for gold.
These gods grant power as readily as the rest — but their price is ruin measured in years, not days.

Those who call upon the Shadow Spiral do so knowing three things:

The favor they take will be paid for in kin-blood.

The mark of their god will follow them into the afterbreath.

No offering to the light will wash away the dark.

To walk the Shadow Spiral is to stand outside clan law, and yet many whisper that whole bloodlines have survived only by walking its hidden path.

---

🌿 The Keepers of Breath — Religious Roles

Spiritcallers — Bridge the breath of living and dead, drawing ancestor-voices through dream, smoke, and bone-flute.
Totembinders — Carve and awaken sacred forms, binding a god’s will to wood, bone, or stone so it may walk with the clan.
Stormseers — Read wind, sky, and bird-flight for omens of war, death, and turning season.
Bloodwrights — Conduct oath-blood rites, sealing kinship, vengeance, or devotion beneath the gaze of the invoked god.

---

⚖ The Law of Sacrifice

Words alone are dust.
Prayer without offering is a hollow breath — an insult.
The gods do not stir for supplicants; they stir for the price paid.
A vow without blood, a plea without pain, an oath without labor — these are spat into the frost and lost.

---

⚖ The Law of Silence

A god’s true name is not spoken without cause.
To speak it idly is to draw their gaze — and their judgment.
The wise invoke through scent-offerings, totem marks, or the god’s animal form.
True names are for blood-oaths, death rites, and war-calls only.

---

🪵 Totemic Binding

Every god claims a primary totem — carved in materials they favor — and a wild form they walk in.
A clan’s totem may bear the marks of multiple gods, but each mark must be carved on its own line.
To mix two in one stroke is to make a lie in wood — and invite both to punish the falsehood.

---

📂 Demihuman Clans — Skarnheim, Northeastern Region

---

🔄 The Spiral of Clans

> Each curve is a life.
Each meeting a bond.
Break the spiral and the pulse dies.

The Spiral is carved into cave walls and bloodstones, its lines curling like windtracks over snow.
Each curve is a clan, none complete alone.
Some bend toward each other in trust, some strain apart in silence, and some have already begun to fray.

The Spiral is not politics — it is breath.
But breath can freeze.
And when it does, even kin will bare teeth.

---

🛡 The Iron Accord — Wall of Stone and Silence

> Not all walls are built to keep the enemy out,
Some are built to keep the truth in,
And some are built to remember what was lost.

The Iron Accord is the shield of the Northeastern lands — a pact of clans who have sworn to hold the passes, guard the valleys, and keep the ancient roads open against siege, Blight, and human encroachment.
Their alliance is as old as the first frost-stones carved into the Spine, sealed in blood when the mountains were thought unbreakable.

In public, they stand as the stalwart counterweight to the Veil Compact’s shadowwork — the visible hand where the Compact is unseen.
In private, they accuse the Veil of playing too close to treachery… while quietly relying on the very intelligence they condemn.

And though their unity is carved deep, whispers coil in the cracks:
One Accord clan accused of trading with human warbands for steel and salt.
Another rumored to have let Blight creep near their borders, watching to see how it might be turned to war.

---

🐺 The Chipped Fang — Wolf Clan

> They scent the storm before the wind.
They hunt until the heart stops.
They die as one or not at all.

Born for the flank and the long kill, the Chipped Fang move with the rhythm of breath and snow.
They patrol the Spine’s shadowed slopes, frost-scorched totems marking every kill as a warning to intruders.
Loyalty is their shield; betrayal is answered in blood and exile.
They are the Accord’s vanguard — its sharpest teeth, its first strike.

Home — Spine’s western passes, north of Frostbrace Hold
Role — Vanguards, survivalists, flank-hunters
Traits — Loyalty-bound, dominance-aware, scent-disciplined
Specialties — Trail warfare, endurance hunts, flank coordination
Cultural Note — Leadership changes only by ritual combat in the snow. The pack is breath — break it, and you choke.
Relations — Ally-blood with the Stonebound Maw; bitter oath-feud with the Shrouded Mist.
Rumor — Some Veil whisper that Chipped Fang patrols have let human raiders pass unchallenged if their prey was Compact-linked.
Primary Patron: Ashamar (wild wind, beast-breath)
Secondary Patrons: Mirell (oath, bloodline), Hrethuun (storm-wrath, ancestral judgment)
Taboo Patron: Kaelthera (lust, ruin, rebirth)

Patron Carving:
The Fang breathe Ashamar’s gale, seal oaths in Mirell’s blood-thread, and sharpen fangs in Hrethuun’s thunder. Yet they spit at Kaelthera’s thorned rose, for pleasure without oath is poison, and no wolf follows ruin’s scent.

---

🐻 The Stonebound Maw — Bear Clan

> They are the last wall when all else falls.
They speak the tongue of earth.
They sleep with the roots of mountains.

Ancient and immovable, the Stonebound Maw guard the lorevaults and mountain gates.
They are the Accord’s foundation — holding fast when others bend.
The Maw do not rush to war; they crush it in their own time, with the inevitability of a glacier grinding stone.

Home — Mountain bastions east of Vowshade Reach
Role — Earth-binders, lorevault guardians, frontline ancients
Traits — Stoic, strong, trance-capable
Specialties — Rootsleep defense, stonecraft, blood-rune combat
Cultural Note — They speak to stone before man. In Accord councils, the Maw’s voice is the last heard — and the one that ends debate.
Relations — Ally-blood with the Chipped Fang; stone-oath with the Duskhollow Watch.
Rumor — The Veil claims the Maw have allowed Blight to touch hidden valleys, studying its spread for reasons they do not share.
Primary Patron: Orvak (earth, endurance)
Secondary Patrons: Mirell (lineage, oath), Vaessra (guardianship, kin-protection)
Taboo Patron: Evarael (Blight, corruption)

Patron Carving:
The Maw kneel to Orvak’s mountain, bear Mirell’s threads unbroken, and scar themselves for Vaessra’s shield. Yet they grind their teeth at Evarael’s rot, for the Maw guard valleys, not graves.

---

🦅 Sunfeather Aerie — Eagle Clan

[Status: Dual Allegiance — Covenant by blood, Accord by pact. This is intentional political intrigue.]

The Aerie nests in cliff-forts where sky and stone meet...

> They do not fall without purpose.
They kill from where no arrow can reach.
They guard the high sun as their own.

Fierce and unbending, the Sunfeather Aerie are duelists of the upper air, holding the high ridges and cliffforts where only the wind dares walk.
Their honor code is carved into bone — a Sunfeather will not strike without cause, but when cause is found, they descend like a falling sun.

Home — Crag-spires above Greenstep Valley, with a fortified seasonal aerie above Mirrorbrand Outpost for southern patrols
Role — Sentinel-duelists, highland wardens
Traits — Fierce, honor-driven, unbending
Specialties — Dive-bomb strikes, sky-overwatch, wind combat
Cultural Note — All hatchlings are blindfolded at birth; true sight is earned when they take their first death-drop flight alone.
Relations — Sky-pact with the Frostclaw; wary cooperation with the Veil’s Windpierce Flight.
Rumor — Some Compact whispers claim Sunfeather scouts have shadowed their flights for weeks at a time, mapping every covert landing.
Primary Patron: Ysolde (prophecy, truth-burning)
Secondary Patrons: Hrethuun (storm-wrath, judgment), Solgaruun (sun, harvest, reaping)
Taboo Patron: Zethrayn (fear, nightmare, silence)

Patron Carving:
The Sunfeather lift Ysolde’s broken mask to the sky, ride Hrethuun’s storms as omens, and reap Solgaruun’s gold for kin. Yet they shun Zethrayn’s shadow, for no hawk hunts blind in fear.

---

🐆 The Duskhollow Watch — Mountain Lion Clan

> They keep the passes no one else dares.
They do not forget a trespass.
They do not forgive a return.

Silent and unyielding, the Duskhollow Watch hold the sacred passes against all who would defile them.
They are the Accord’s shadowed sentinels — unseen until you have crossed a line you did not know was there.

Home — Steep cliff passes south of Mirrorbrand Outpost
Role — Ridge sentinels, sacred pass guardians
Traits — Quiet, firm, territory-bound
Specialties — Steep terrain combat, mountain lairs, last-stand defense
Cultural Note — Trespass in Duskhollow territory is met without parley. They hold ground until death — and beyond.
Relations — Stone-oath with the Stonebound Maw; cold neutrality with the Veil Compact.
Rumor — Certain Compact scouts claim Duskhollow patrols have captured Veil messengers and sent them home carrying false intelligence.
Primary Patron: Avarael (moon, memory, mercy)
Secondary Patrons: Ysolde (prophecy, knowing), Thal’ruun (ancestor-echoes)
Taboo Patron: Thryssan (false justice, corruption)

Patron Carving:
The Hollow whisper Avarael’s moon into the frost, keep Ysolde’s firelit truth, and rouse Thal’ruun’s bone-echoes. Yet they spit at Thryssan’s scales, for no wisdom bends to coin.

---

🐯 The Frostclaw — Snow Tiger Clan

> They fall like stone from the clouds.
They kill before the echo fades.
They leave only the scent of blood and ash.

Once believed to have been wiped out in the Blight War, the Frostclaw have clawed their way back from near extinction. Scattered survivors and hidden bloodlines have reformed in recent winters into the Accord’s shock-strike predators — descending from cliffs in a blur of fur and steel.

Home — Cliff ranges north of Sorrowrun Keep
Role — Cliff-bound pouncers, shock-strike vanguard
Traits — Graceful, forceful, elevation-adapted
Specialties — Ambush-leaping, fog warfare, pulse-reading prey
Cultural Note — Ash is streaked in their fur before war; they strike without warning or mercy.
Relations — Sky-pact with the Sunfeather Aerie; cautious alliance with the Chipped Fang. The Sky-pact is upheld through shared patrols over the central Spine, meeting at the Windknife Cliffs where both clans’ hunting ranges overlap.
Rumor — Some say the Frostclaw once sold their claws to human mercenaries — not for coin, but for southern hunting rights.
Primary Patron: Kaervael (snow, stillness)
Secondary Patrons: Hrethuun (storm-wrath), Vesska (ice, judgment)
Taboo Patron: Vel’Thir (pain, ordeal, threshold)

Patron Carving:
The Frostclaw crouch in Kaervael’s stillness, strike in Hrethuun’s thunder, and carve Vesska’s judgments in snow. Yet they deny Vel’Thir’s thorns, for the Frostclaw kill clean, not slow.

---

⚖ The Weight of the Wall

> A wall does not ask who it shelters.
A wall does not choose who it keeps out.
A wall endures until it falls.

The Iron Accord stands as the most visible shield in the Northeast — its banners, its walls, and its warriors symbols of safety.
Yet even stone has fault lines.
They mistrust the Veil’s whispers yet rely on their intelligence.
They condemn trade with humans yet bargain with them in shadows.
In Skarnheim’s cold war, the Accord may stand taller than all others — but the higher the wall, the deeper the shadow it casts.

---

🕯 The Veil Compact — The Hand in Shadow

> Not all battles are fought in the open,
Not all blades are drawn from scabbards,
And not all wars end when the killing stops.

The Veil Compact is not a shield, but a shadow — a coalition of clans who work unseen, manipulating the field before the battle is ever joined.
They hold no wall, but they decide where the enemy will strike.
They speak no law, but they decide who will live long enough to hear it.

To the Iron Accord, they are untrustworthy meddlers.
To the Green Covenant, they are necessary evil.
To the Broken Spiral, they are competition — and occasional patrons.

In truth, the Veil lives in the gray between oaths, bending rules to keep the Spiral unbroken. They thrive on information, rumor, and invisible pressure. And while they have saved the Northeast more times than the Accord will admit, no one forgets that the Veil’s dagger can turn inward as easily as out.

Persistent Rumors —
Whispers claim that coded messages have been intercepted bearing marks not of the Compact, but of something older, darker, and nearer the Blight.
Certain Compact scouts have been seen meeting with “festival troupes” who vanish without trace after their performances.
And once in a while, a clan finds that the Veil’s perfect intelligence led them straight into a place the frost itself refuses to reclaim.

---

🦊 The Shrouded Mist — Fox Clan

> They vanish between heartbeats.
They speak in shadows.
They return only when the game is theirs.

Masters of deception, the Shrouded Mist weave false trails and false truths with equal skill.
They can ruin an enemy warband without drawing a blade, or ignite a feud between clans with a single whisper in the right ear.
The Mist claim to serve the Spiral, but they serve it on their own terms — and their terms are often unreadable until it’s too late.

Home — Frost-hollowed valleys east of Vowshade Reach
Role — Illusionists, political disruptors, covert saboteurs
Traits — Subtle, perceptive, emotionally masked
Specialties — Veil magic, scent-masking, dream infiltration
Cultural Note — Foxes court under the moon with ash-marked fur; to refuse a mark is to declare an enemy.
Relations — Tied in shadow-oath to the Shadowed Wing; sworn enemies of the Chipped Fang since the Betrayal of the Veil.
Rumor — Accord whispers claim the Mist have traded in human slaves — not for profit, but for the leverage their chains can buy.
Primary Patron: Vesska (ice, silence, judgment)
Secondary Patrons: Drenasha (night, devotion, hidden strength), Mirell (blood, lineage, oath)
Taboo Patron: Siraan (trickery, false laughter, poison-lore)

Patron Carving:
The Mist vanish in Vesska’s frost-silence, cloak themselves in Drenasha’s unseen loyalty, and seal their oaths in Mirell’s blood-thread. Their strength is in whispers carried by snow. Yet they refuse Siraan’s mask, for a lie spoken for mirth is weakness — and the Mist’s deceptions are always knives.

---

🦅 The Shadowed Wing — Raven Clan

> They see what storms hide.
They speak to the dead without fear.
They never bring the living comfort.

The Shadowed Wing walk the border between the living and the dead, gathering truths no one wants spoken aloud.
They hold the Compact’s deepest archives — secrets bound in feather, bone, and breath.
When the Wing arrives in your territory, you know the Compact has already decided your fate.

Home — Blackpine ridges north of Bleaktithe Vault
Role — Spirit-guides, death-keepers, intelligence archivists
Traits — Wry, watchful, shadow-bound
Specialties — Sky pathfinding, spirit-channeling, chaos divination
Cultural Note — Speak in riddles to the dying; to answer plainly is to invite bad death.
Relations — Shadow-oath with the Shrouded Mist; wary exchanges with the Sunfeather Aerie.
Rumor — It is said the Wing have called storms to sink human supply ships — and then sold the cargo to the very clans they warned away.
Primary Patron: Drenasha (night, devotion, hidden strength)
Secondary Patrons: Vesska (ice, silence, judgment), Thonruk (war, sacrifice, fire)
Taboo Patron: Thryssan (false justice, corruption)

Patron Carving:
The Wing roost in Drenasha’s black sky, read Vesska’s frozen seals, and strike only when Thonruk’s war-bell tolls. They archive storms, weigh deaths, and carry secrets like feathers. Yet they will not touch Thryssan’s coin-tipped scales — for justice bound to silver is no justice at all.

---

🦅 The Windpierce Flight — Falcon Clan

> They ride the storm’s edge.
They do not waste a word or a wingbeat.
They strike at the moment the wind turns.

The Windpierce are the Compact’s couriers of war — but they carry more than messages.
Every delivery is a chance to plant a seed: a half-truth, a coded warning, a rumor timed to bloom at the worst possible moment for the enemy.
They are as much strategists as messengers, reading the flow of battle from the wind itself.

Home — Cliff-spires along the eastern coast near Mirrorbrand Outpost
Role — Tactical messengers, high-speed infiltrators
Traits — Swift, obsessive, tactical
Specialties — Dive-ambush, storm navigation, lightning relay tactics
Cultural Note — Feathers are tied with silver thistle and blood-silk threads upon reaching battle speed; losing a tie in flight is considered a grave omen.
Relations — Cooperative rivalry with the Sunfeather Aerie; secret storm-pact with the Frostclaw.
Rumor — Accord loyalists claim the Windpierce have delivered false orders to entire warbands, sending them to die in ambushes meant for someone else.
Primary Patron: Ashamar (wind, wildness, breath of beasts)
Secondary Patrons: Hrethuun (storm, ancestral wrath), Drenasha (night, devotion, hidden strength)
Taboo Patron: Vaeril (flame, purity, hunger)

Patron Carving:
The Flight rides Ashamar’s gale, cuts through Hrethuun’s storm-light, and carries Drenasha’s whispers across the dark. Their wings are messengers, their dives decisions. Yet they spurn Vaeril’s flame, for fire burns away shadow — and the Flight’s work lives in its shelter.

---

⚖ The Price of the Shadow

> A shadow can hide you.
A shadow can hide from you.
A shadow can hide nothing forever.

The Veil Compact wins battles no one ever sees, but its victories come with debts — and its debts are always collected.
They speak of unity, but unity on their terms.
They fight the Blight, but they decide which battlefields will burn.
In Skarnheim’s cold war, the Veil is the whisper that shapes the shout — and the silence that follows it.

---

🌲 The Green Covenant — Roots Beneath Stone

> The frost breaks stone,
The stone breaks root,
Yet the root waits longer than them both.

The Green Covenant is the pulse of Skarnheim’s soil — a bloc of clans bound to the lifeways of forest, field, and rain.
They are not wall-builders or shadow-weavers; they are the ones who keep the land alive so that any war can be fought at all.
Without them, the Accord’s walls would starve and the Veil’s messengers would freeze on barren trails.

Their alliances are patient and deliberate.
Their grudges are older than the oldest fortress stones.
And while they rarely strike first, when they do, it is with the inevitability of roots breaking rock.

The Covenant speaks often of balance — but in truth, their balance is maintained with a blade hidden in the furrow.

Persistent Rumors —
Now and then, a healer’s poultice works too well — mending wounds that should have left scars, or leaving a scent the Blight follows for weeks.
Some border crops are said to have grown without planting, bearing black-veined leaves that vanish before elders can examine them.
And in one winter, a Covenant grain caravan disappeared for a month, only to return with twice its load and no record of where the extra had come from.

Note: The Sunfeather Aerie are Covenant kin but appear also in the Iron Accord listing due to divided loyalties. Their dual placement is deliberate.

---

🐰 The Shaded Hollow — Rabbit Warren

> They know the song of the soil.
They bind wounds with roots and rain.
They vanish into earth when death walks near.

The Shaded Hollow are healers, herbalists, and scouts — the lifeblood of the Covenant’s survival.
They map the underground as others map the sky, moving entire warrens unseen beneath the frost.
No army marches far without their foraged stores, and no wounded warrior lives long without their poultices.

Home — Labyrinthine groves and burrow-holds west of Frostbrace Hold
Role — Herbalists, scouts, spiritual guides
Traits — Empathic, soil-bound, nervous yet knowing
Specialties — Herbal alchemy, soil reading, wound-sense
Cultural Note — Every healer is a sworn witness to both birth and death; to refuse either is exile.
Relations — Life-oath with the Winter’s Paw; deep trade pact with the Ashgaze Kin.
Rumor — Veil spies whisper that certain Hollow warrens have grown crops for human garrisons — not for coin, but for promises yet to be called in.
Primary Patron: Eilun (healing, birth, soil)
Secondary Patrons: Mirell (blood, lineage, oath), Ashamar (wind, wildness, breath of beasts)
Taboo Patron: Vaeril (flame, purity, hunger)

Patron Carving:
The Hollow breathe in Eilun’s soil-song, bind wounds beneath Mirell’s lineage-mark, and vanish along Ashamar’s beast-wind. Their rites are slow as root-growth, their pacts as deep as earthwater. Every birth and death they witness is a prayer turned into seed.

---

🐱 The Winter’s Paw — Lynx Clan

> They watch where others cannot see.
They move where snow will not tell.
They strike when silence grows too heavy.

Silent watchers of the high ridges, the Winter’s Paw guard the Covenant’s borders from above.
They are patient hunters, more often letting enemies pass unchallenged than revealing their presence — until the strike will change everything.

Home — High-ridge forests north of Daggerrest
Role — Horizon watchers, ridge hunters
Traits — Solitary, honed, stress-reactive
Specialties — Snow-camouflage, distant tracking, avalanche survival
Cultural Note — Lynx seers are said to watch not just the horizon, but the years ahead.
Relations — Life-oath with the Shaded Hollow; neutral trade with the Stonebound Maw.
Rumor — Accord scouts claim the Winter’s Paw have allowed Blight incursions to pass unhindered — tracking them deeper into Accord lands to “study their spread.”
Primary Patron: Ashamar (wind, wildness, breath of beasts)
Secondary Patrons: Vesska (ice, silence, judgment), Eilun (healing, birth, soil)
Taboo Patron: Vel’Thir (pain, ordeal, threshold)

Patron Carving:
The Paw move under Ashamar’s breath, stalk in Vesska’s frost-judgment, and anchor themselves in Eilun’s stillness. Their kills are offered in silence; their watch is a winter-long vigil no fire dares break.

---

🦅 The Sunfeather Aerie — Eagle Clan

> They do not fall without purpose.
They kill from where no arrow can reach.
They guard the high sun as their own.

The Sunfeather are the Covenant’s high wardens — sentinels who watch the skies and strike from impossible angles.
Their duels are legend, and their high crags mark the Covenant’s aerial borders.

Home — Though they swear to the Covenant, their seasonal aerie above Mirrorbrand Outpost places them uncomfortably close to Iron Accord lands — a fact both blocs quietly exploit.
Role — Sentinel-duelists, highland wardens
Traits — Fierce, honor-driven, unbending
Specialties — Dive-bomb strikes, sky-overwatch, wind combat
Cultural Note — All hatchlings are blindfolded at birth; they earn true sight by surviving the death-drop alone.
Relations — Sky-pact with the Frostclaw; tense rivalry with the Windpierce Flight.
Rumor — Veil agents claim certain Sunfeather duels have been fought not for honor — but for the right to control critical mountain passes to the Accord’s heartland.
Primary Patron: Ysolde (prophecy, truth-burning)
Secondary Patrons: Hrethuun (storm-wrath, judgment), Solgaruun (sun, harvest, reaping)
Taboo Patron: Zethrayn (fear, nightmare, silence)

Patron Carving:
The Sunfeather lift Ysolde’s broken mask to the sky, ride Hrethuun’s storms as omens, and reap Solgaruun’s gold for kin. Yet they shun Zethrayn’s shadow, for no hawk hunts blind in fear.

---

⚖ The Roots Beneath the Frost

> A wall falls when its stones crack.
A shadow fades when the light shifts.
But the root — the root waits.

The Green Covenant claims neutrality in the Cold War of Skarnheim — yet their patience hides a blade.
They feed every bloc, yet could starve any of them with a single season’s refusal.
They speak for balance, yet keep ledgers of every debt in soil and seed.
And when the frost bites deepest, it is the Covenant’s stores — or their silence — that decides who survives the winter.

---

🩸 The Broken Spiral — Shadow and Betrayal

> Some curves in the Spiral do not lead home.
Some turn inward until they devour themselves.
Some lead straight into the Blight.

The Broken Spiral is not an alliance so much as a pact of convenience between predators, profiteers, and oath-broken bloodlines.
Its members do not stand together in open war — they trade in debts, poison, and shadows.
Each clan has been cut from the greater Spiral for crimes unrepented, but exile has not made them weak.
If anything, it has stripped away every restraint.

They are the blade in the dark while the Veil Compact is still sharpening theirs.
The Iron Accord calls them rabid.
The Green Covenant calls them rootless.
But every bloc has dealt with them when the price was right.

---

🐺🦊 The Hollowfang Pact — Coyote Clan

> They carry every story worth telling.
They fight with laughter.
They mourn only in silence.

Mimics and lorebearers, the Hollowfang Pact turn truth into a weapon sharper than any fang.
They barter in stories — some true, most poisoned — and their tongues can topple as many walls as any siege engine.
To hire a Hollowfang is to invite chaos and hope your enemies choke first.

Home — Nomadic through borderlands and human frontiers.
Role — Storycarriers, cross-clan jesters, tactical mimics
Traits — Humorous, unpredictable, lore-guarded
Specialties — Story warfare, mimic strategy, spiritual pranks
Cultural Note — They collect the last words of dying enemies and weave them into victory songs.
Relations — Trade whispers with the Veil Compact; occasionally ally with the Bobcats for assassinations.
Rumor — Once sold a false prophecy to the Chipped Fang that led to an entire winter campaign collapsing into an ambush.
Primary Patron: Kaelthera (lust, ruin, rebirth)
Secondary Patrons: Mirell (blood, lineage, oath), Ashamar (wind, wildness, breath of beasts)
Taboo Patron: Vesska (ice, silence, judgment)

Patron Carving:
The Hollowfang twist Kaelthera’s ruin into laughter, bind Mirell’s threads into poisoned songs, and scatter Ashamar’s breath like wildfire tales. But they deny Vesska’s frost, for silence kills their chaos — and no jest survives the snow’s judgment.
Entanglements — Known to feed crafted “intelligence” to the Shrouded Mist in exchange for protection during their own operations. Rumored to maintain a standing “festival troupe” contract with the Sunfeather Aerie, using performances to scout highland defenses.

---

🦝 The Ashgaze Kin — Raccoon Clan

> They make tools from ruin.
They find paths where none exist.
They learn the secrets of what is left behind.

The Ashgaze are scavengers, thieves, and inventors — dangerous because they can turn any ruin into a weapon.
They trade in relics too cursed for other clans to touch, and it is said they can smuggle a blade through any blockade.

Home — Hollowed ruins east of Bleaktithe Vault
Role — Relic scavengers, trapbreakers, urban infiltrators
Traits — Cunning, tool-wielding, hyper-curious
Specialties — Artifact retrieval, improvisation, night-entry
Cultural Note — Innovation is a blood-oath; failure is paid for in exile.
Relations — Trade with the Shaded Hollow; black-market exchanges with human warbands. Their trade with the Shaded Hollow is maintained via a Veil-protected courier trail cutting through unmapped highland passes, avoiding Accord toll-gates.
Rumor — Veil whispers claim Ashgaze artisans have reforged Blight-tainted weapons for sale to the highest bidder.
Primary Patron: Vesska (ice, silence, judgment)
Secondary Patrons: Mirell (blood, lineage, oath), Kaelthera (lust, ruin, rebirth)
Taboo Patron: Eilun (healing, birth, soil)

Patron Carving:
The Ashgaze scavenge beneath Vesska’s sealed eye, stitch Mirell’s threads through stolen steel, and etch Kaelthera’s ruin into relics reborn. Yet they spurn Eilun’s cradle, for healers mend what they profit from breaking.
Entanglements — Regularly sell “cleaned” artifacts to the Stonebound Maw under false provenances. Maintain covert salvage rights in Green Covenant lands via unmarked Shaded Hollow intermediaries.

---

🐆 The Emberback — Bobcat Clan

> They kill in one breath.
They follow without shadow.
They leave only patience behind.

Lethal, territorial, and as patient as frostbite, the Emberback are the Broken Spiral’s executioners.
They do not waste their claws on warning kills — when they strike, it is because someone has already been paid for the body.

Home — Remote crags and forested ridges near human warpaths.
Role — Lone assassins, trackless scouts
Traits — Reflexive, territorial, brutal
Specialties — Single-strike kills, soft-step tracking, fast escape
Cultural Note — They carve blood-sigils into their kills; no two are ever the same.
Relations — Deadly rivals to the Frostclaw; quiet working relationship with the Black Maw Syndicate.
Rumor — Known to take coin from human slavers if the target is a rival clan’s scout or diplomat.
Primary Patron: Thonruk (war, sacrifice, fire)
Secondary Patrons: Vesska (ice, silence, judgment), Ashamar (wind, wildness, breath of beasts)
Taboo Patron: Avarael (moon, memory, mercy)

Patron Carving:
The Emberback strike in Thonruk’s flame, mark their kills with Vesska’s frost, and vanish on Ashamar’s storm-breath. But they reject Avarael’s mercy, for memory is weakness and forgiveness leaves a target standing.
Entanglements — Contracted for “deniable” eliminations by certain Veil Compact agents, especially the Windpierce Flight. Rumored to have trained select Iron Accord warriors in cliff-kill tactics under assumed identities.

🐺🩸 The Black Maw Syndicate — Outcast Conglomerate Clan

> They trade in blood, breath, and chains.
They break the Spiral for coin.
They bow only to the weight of gold.

The Black Maw Syndicate is not a clan in the old sense — it is a mercantile predator, built from outcast demihumans and hard-eyed humans who chose profit over kin.
They run smuggling trails, flesh markets, and warband contracts across the Northeast, selling to anyone with the silver to pay.
In battle, they fight like a pack that owes each other nothing — because they don’t.

Home — Hidden market strongholds along the Spine’s shadowed passes.
Role — Smugglers, slaver-lords, contract raiders
Traits — Ruthless, pragmatic, loyalty-for-sale
Specialties — Smuggling, siege provisioning, high-value captures
Cultural Note — There is no shared blood here — only shared profit. A Maw’s kin is whoever keeps the coin flowing.
Relations — Secret supply pacts with certain Iron Accord warbands; open trade with human slaver guilds.
Rumor — Alleged to have delivered a Veil Compact envoy directly into Blightborn territory — alive.
Primary Patron: Mirell (blood, lineage, oath)
Secondary Patrons: Kaelthera (lust, ruin, rebirth), Thonruk (war, sacrifice, fire)
Taboo Patron: Eilun (healing, birth, soil)

Patron Carving:
The Maw bind Mirell’s blood into chains, twist Kaelthera’s ruin into coin, and spill Thonruk’s fire on command. But they deny Eilun’s soil, for life and birth yield no profit, and the Maw kneels only to silver.
Entanglements — Supply illicit siege rations to Frostclaw and Chipped Fang warbands via neutral traders. Allegedly launder coin through Covenant grain markets under false clan names.

🩸 The Blightborn Choir — Corrupted Outcast Clan

> They speak with the voice of the Rot.
They pray in the dark where the frost does not reach.
They dream of the day the Blight sings loud enough to drown the world.

The Blightborn Choir are the Spiral’s great heresy — demihumans and humans infected, but not yet claimed, who worship the Blight as a divine force.
They spread infection deliberately, offering “the gift” to enemies and converts alike.
They see themselves not as traitors, but as heralds.

Home — Ruined frost-temples and Blight-scarred valleys.
Role — Cult infiltrators, infection spreaders, heretical seers
Traits — Fanatic, patient, other-voiced
Specialties — Covert infection, ritual corruption, Blight omen-reading
Cultural Note — They keep their names from before infection, but speak them backwards as a mark of rebirth.
Relations — Uneasy coexistence with the Syndicate; despised openly by the Green Covenant.
Rumor — Some Choir members are said to be “sleeping” Overmind seeds, awaiting the command to awaken into full Blight forms.
Primary Patron: Kaelthera (lust, ruin, rebirth)
Secondary Patrons: Mirell (blood, lineage, oath), Vesska (ice, silence, judgment)
Taboo Patron: Ashamar (wind, wildness, breath of beasts)

Patron Carving:
The Choir sing Kaelthera’s ruin as rebirth, bleed Mirell’s lineage into rot, and praise Vesska’s frost as seal upon plague. Yet they spurn Ashamar’s breath, for the beast’s wild freedom wars against their chosen decay.
Entanglements — Rumors persist of Veil Compact messengers unknowingly carrying Choir sigils as part of their own coded deliveries. Whispers also claim a handful of Shaded Hollow herbalists have been given “gift seeds” that sprout more than medicine.

⚖ The Weight of the Shadow

> Not all enemies charge the gate.
Some open it from the inside.
Some sell the key.

The Broken Spiral is not strong in numbers — it is strong in reach.
Its claws are in every bloc, its whispers in every hall.
No one admits to needing them.
No one doubts that they will be needed.

🏔 Independent Clans

⚔ The GrimHowl — The Rage Unbound

> They walk the lands like ghosts wearing human skin.
They are kin to none, yet their blood carries the weight of valleys lost.
When the rage comes, the Spiral itself trembles.

The GrimHowl stand outside all accords.
They answer no summons, swear no allegiance, and sign no pact.
To some, they are a memory of when the Spiral was one; to others, they are a warning of what happens when a clan is burned to its last ember.

Their neutrality is not mercy — it is distance.
Those who try to claim them often find that the rage remembers every debt, and collects with interest.

Home — Nomadic, scattered in human lands and hidden valleys.
Role — Ragebound wanderers, ancestral echoes, myth-walkers.
Rumor — Both the Iron Accord and the Veil Compact have covertly offered them sanctuary, coin, or blood-oaths in exchange for allegiance. All offers have been refused — sometimes with words, sometimes with bodies left in the snow.
⚔ The GrimHowl — The Rage Unbound

Primary Patron: Thonruk (war, sacrifice, fire)
Secondary Patrons: Ashamar (wind, wildness, breath of beasts), Mirell (blood, lineage, oath)
Taboo Patron: Vesska (ice, silence, judgment)

Patron Carving:
The GrimHowl burn with Thonruk’s war-fire, breathe Ashamar’s wild hunt, and bleed Mirell’s oath-thread raw. Their rage is worship — each howl a hymn, each strike a covenant. Yet they deny Vesska’s frost, for silence chains the scream, and judgment dares not bind what already walks unbound.
