🧬 Backstory

Thayren’s first breath was not his own.

Born beneath a black birch tree during a storm that cracked mountain ice, he was still, blue-lipped, and scentless. His mother — a bone-witch of the Hollowline — bound his limbs in wolfbone twine, carved his name into ash bark, and buried it beside the skull of her father.

Three nights passed. On the fourth, the wolves stopped howling.

When she returned, he was standing among the graves — silent, watching, alive in a way no newborn should be.

He does not shift. He does not rage.  
But the dead remember him, and he remembers them.  
He walks with the frost in his lungs and the whisper of every bone he’s ever touched.

💠 Core Traits

- No Rage Shift: His rage becomes spirit-force and ancestral disruption. No shift form.
- Spirit Memory: In any place death has occurred, Thayren remembers one death — name, scent, and final emotion.
- Frostbound Soul: Immune to possession, Blight-channeling, and echo inversion.
- Bone-Touched: Physical contact with bones grants fragments of instinct, pain, or knowledge — never verbal, always sensed.
- Silent Communion: Thayren speaks to the dead through scent, echo, or ritual. He does not defile — he honors and remembers.

  - Ritual or combat staves (bone, frostwood, purified Blight-carved)
